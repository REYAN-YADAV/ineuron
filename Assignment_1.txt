1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

* = expression Because it is mathematical operators.

'hello' = vlaue Because it is string.

-87.8 = value Because it is floot number

-  = expression because it is subtraction operators.

/ = expression because it is divide operators.

+ = expression because it is add operators.

6 = value because it is integer.


2. What is the difference between string and variable?
=> string = a sequence of character encosed within single or double quotes.
   variable = it s a type of storage, which contain data types.
   example=> name = "reyan"  # Here name is variable and reyan is string.
   
3. Describe three different data types.
=> There are many type of data types likes
    a) int  = we can use int data type to represent whole number.
    ex. a = 10
    b) float = we can use float data type to represent decimal number. 
    ex. b = 10.3
    c) str = we can use str data type to represent string 
    ex. c = "reyan"
    d) bool = we can use bool data type to represent boolean values there are only True and False are allowed values.
    ex. d = True
    e) list = if we want to represent a group of values as a single entity where ensertion order required and duplicates are             allowed.
    ex. e = [12,23,'reyan','ineuron']
    f) complex =  we can use complex data type to represent complex number. etc..
    ex. f = 2+4j

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
=> An expression is made the combination of operators and operands. an expression produces some value or result after interpreted by python interpretor.
   example. x = x + 20
   
5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
=> Here spam = 10, is an statement. statement is not evaluate for some result. A statement used for creating a variable.

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
      bacon = 22
      bacon + 1
 ====> it simply execute without error. in result we got nothing.
         if print(bacon + 1) = 23
         
7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
 =>    'spam'+ 'spamspam' =  'spamspamspam'. # it will concatante bcoz both are string
       'spam' * 3 =   'spamspamspam'. # spam repeat 3 times bcoz 'spam' is string and 3 is int so string multiplication happened.
 
8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
=> Here here eggs for pytohn identifiers but 100 is not bcoz a variable never start with a number.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
=> int() = for integer
   float() = for floating-point number
   str() = for string
   
10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
     'I have eaten' + 99 +'burritos'
=> this expression cause an error because here we want to concatantae a string with integer.
    it should we like this = 'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos'
    or 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos'
